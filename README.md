# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System can be used for managing the employees at any Organization.
The frontend uses React whereas the backend uses Microservices based approach.

The backend comprises of the following microservices:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/sat5297/authMicroservice" target="_blank"> Authentication Microservice </a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/sat5297/employeeMicroservice" target="_blank"> Employee Microservice </a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/sat5297/managerMicroservice" target="_blank"> Manager Microservice </a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/sat5297/leaveMicroservice" target="_blank"> Leave Microservice </a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/sat5297/payrollMicroservice" target="_blank"> Payroll Microservice </a></li>
</ul>

The System provides the following functionalities:
<ul>
    <li>Create/Read/Update/Delete Employee in the database.</li>
    <li>Register/Login/ChangePassword for the users.</li>

</ul>

The following Databases are used with same table name:

    <li>authentication <p> Table : Login </p> </li>
    <li>payroll</li>

The System uses the following mechanism for storing the passwords:

    <li>The user can change the password.</li>
    <li>The passwords are stored after 10 rounds of Salting.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>mkdir empMgmt </li>
    <li>cd empMgmt </li>
    <li>mkdir backend frontend</li>
    <li>cd backend --> make dir for all microservices and clone here.</li>
    <li>cd frontend ---> make dir for frontend and clone here.</li>
    <li> start all the microservices in different terminals. <b> npm run devStart</b></li>
    <li> start the frontend <b> nodemon run start </b> </li>
    <li> We have the admin user with managerID 1 as the root user. (We just need it to create first user)</li>
    <li> Create the user in authentication database using postman. </li>
    <li> Now you have the project Up and Running and available to use.</li>
  </ul>
    
    
The Microservices based approach will be helpful for scaling the system as and when needed. <br/>
Dockerized version of the System coming soon.üòâÔ∏è
